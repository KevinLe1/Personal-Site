<h1>About </h1>
	<p> I am a freshman at Columbia University in the Fu Foundation School of Engineering and Applied Sciences (SEAS). Ever since I first got involved with science and engineering back on my high school robotics team, I have been in love with the idea of being able to build something up from scratch. Whether it be through STEM, business, or music, I hope to create things that will have a lasting impact. Feel free to view some of my projects below!
	<br><br>
	<strong>Skills</strong>: Java, C++, HTML/CSS, Javascript, Arduino, Linux, CAD (Solidworks)/3D Printing

	<h2> LHS MakerSpace ("OpenSource") </h2>
		<p> At my former high school (Lexington High School, Lexington, MA), there were almost no engineering supports for students at the school besides the student-run robotics team, which had its own limitations. In response, I established an experimental MakerSpace called "OpenSource" with minor funding from the Lexington Education Foundation (LEF) for students to create whatever, whenever. Since then, it has expanded into the largest engineering education support at LHS with its own space and computer lab along with use both in and out of school by students and faculty. </p>

	<h2> Elementary Engineering Education Reform </h2>
		<p> Similar to my high school, the six elementary schools in my town also lacked engineering supports. After running robotics classes for young students independently for over a year, it was clear that there was a demand. I led an initiative to get the school system to invest in new engineering supports and designed original engineering curricula and teacher training materials. After a successful pilot year, the curriculum is becoming fully integrated across the Lexington, MA school system.

	<h2> FIRST Tech Challenge Robotics </h2>
		<p> Captain of 2 Bits and a Byte (FTC 4029), the LHS robotics team from 2014-2016. During both years of my captainship the team qualified to the FTC World Championship and made it to World Division Semi-Finals in the 2015-2016 season. Over a dozen various awards won from 2014-2016, along with a quadrupling of team funds. </p>

	<h2> Forsyth Independent Research </h2>
		<p> In Fall of 2014, a friend and I presented an original research proposal concerning the interactions between <em>M. smegmtatis</em> (closely related to <em> M. tuberculosis </em>) and <em>C. elegans </em> to the <a href = "https://www.forsyth.org/immunology-and-infectious-diseases">Forsyth Institute's Immunology Department</a>. The following summer, we were invited to conduct our research at the facility with full funding.

	<h2> LexHack </h2>
		<p> Co-founded and led an annual 150+ student high school hackathon in the Greater Boston Area. Beginning in 2014, it was the first high school hackathon in Massachusetts run exclusively by high school students. Learn more at:

	<h2> Music </h2>
		<p> Since I was a kid, I have been playing piano. After receiving numerous accolades through the National Piano Guild, I began writing music independently when I was 14. A hobby of mine, it is something that has always made me appreciate the way art affects our world. Soundcloud:  </p>
