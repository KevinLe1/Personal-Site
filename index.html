	<h2> Advanced Acoustic Concepts (AAC) -<strong> Software Engineering Intern</strong></h2>
		<p> Advanced Acoustic Concepts is a naval defense contractor owned by DRS/Thales. I developed the backend of an automated system testing infrastructure prototype for AAC's tactical simulation software. Previously, any simulation scenario could only be run manually. The prototype allowed any amount and kind of test to be run based off user-specific criteria. By the end of the summer, the prototype was deemed successful and viable, moving to a partial implementation phase.

	<h2> Engineers Without Borders (Columbia University Chapter) -<strong> Morocco Water Project Lead and Fundraising Chair</strong></h2>
		<p> Engineers Without Borders is an organization of various collegiate and professional chapters that work on designing and implementing infrastructural solutions to developing communities. As Columbia's Engineers Without Borders-Morocco water project lead, my responsiblity is to lead a team of ten students in all aspects of developing a clean water distribution system for Ait Bayoud, Morocco. Additionally, I served as the fundraising chair for Engineers Without Borders-Morocco, raising $1,000/semester.

	<h2> Columbia Space Initiative -<strong> NASA Micro-G NeXT Team Member and Outreach Lead</strong></h2>
		<p> As a part of the Micro-G NeXT team, I worked on a small team to develop a subsurface sampling device for asteroid use. Given a set of design criteria, the device was expected to be able to collect both regolith (similar to sand/gravel) and rock core samples while maintaining stratification. After design approval, the device was manufactured and presented at NASA's Neutral Buoyancy Lab in June 2017. There, it was the most successful device at collecting regolith. I also acted as the team's outreach lead, organizing several aerospace workshops and presentations within NYC.

	<h2> HealthHacks NYC -<strong> Branding Lead</strong></h2>
		<p> HealthHacks NYC was Columbia's first ever medical-themed hackathon. It was a 36 hour event bringing in hundreds of college students from around the country to program and build solutions to today's health problems. As the branding lead, I was responsible for creating branded material for marketing and communication purposes, as well as helping to define the vision for the event. The total valuation of the event in the end was $30,000.

	<h2> Elementary Engineering Education Reform </h2>
		<p> Led a $10,000 initiative to get the school system to invest in new engineering supports and designed original engineering curricula and teacher training materials. After a successful pilot year, the curriculum is becoming fully integrated across the Lexington, MA school system, with $20,000 added to funding, and I transitioned the project to a new team.

	<h2> Forsyth Independent Research </h2>
		<p> In Fall of 2014, a friend and I presented an original research proposal concerning the interactions between <em>M. smegmtatis</em> (closely related to <em> M. tuberculosis </em>) and <em>C. elegans </em> to the <a href = "https://www.forsyth.org/immunology-and-infectious-diseases">Forsyth Institute's Immunology Department</a>. The following summer, we were invited to conduct our research at the facility with full funding.
