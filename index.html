	<h2> Forsyth Independent Research </h2>
		<p> In Fall of 2014, a friend and I presented an original research proposal concerning the interactions between <em>M. smegmtatis</em> (closely related to <em> M. tuberculosis </em>) and <em>C. elegans </em> to the <a href = "https://www.forsyth.org/immunology-and-infectious-diseases">Forsyth Institute's Immunology Department</a>. The following summer, we were invited to conduct our research at the facility with full funding.

	<h2>Music Composition</h2>
		<p>Since I was a kid, I have been playing piano. After receiving numerous accolades through the National Piano Guild, I began writing music independently at the age of 14. My music has been recognized internationally and I've had the privilege to perform as far as Vienna. A hobby of mine, it is something that has always made me appreciate the way art affects individuals and society.

	<h2>Custom Analog Synthesizer (On-Going Project)</h2>
		<p>Inspired by my passion for music, this is a project I've wanted to do for a while. A few friends and I were awarded a $350 grant from the Columbia College Student Council, and it is expected to be completed some time in April. Stay tuned for a video!</p>

	<h2>Engineers Without Borders (Columbia Chapter) - <strong>Water Project Lead and Fundraising Chair</strong></h2>
		<p>Engineers Without Borders designs and builds infrastructure for developing communities. I am responsible for overseeing all aspects of a project to develop and implement a clean water access system for Ait Bayoud in Morocco. Currently, the team is working on sediment filtration, chemical purification, and on constructing a temporary distribution site. The goal is for the aforementioned to be built in Morocco over Summer 2017. As fundraising chair, it is also my responsibility to ensure that we raise enough money to travel and implement the chapter's solutions.

	<h2>Columbia Space Initiative (CSI) - <strong>Micro-G Outreach Lead and Micro-G NeXT Design Member</strong></h2>
		<p>Columbia's undergraduate aerospace club; I am on the Micro-G NeXT team. In Micro-G NeXT, I am part of a small team developing a novel subsurface sampling device for astronaut use on asteroids which is able to work on a purely mechanical basis (no motors or electricity). The device should be able to take both surface and core samples (modelled as regolith and sandstone, respectively) while maintaining stratification. Our design was approved by NASA and we are currently in a manufacturing phase. As an outreach lead, I also organize numerous events in the community such as aerospace workshops for local community centers.

	<h2>Barnard-Columbia Design for America (DFA) - <strong>Studio Member</strong></h2>
		<p>DFA is a multidisciplinary group focused on human-centered design. I am on a subteam exploring ways to address environmental inequity in NYC. Last semester, I worked on modelling a concept design for solar units designed specifically for apartment residents. This semester, my subteam has pivoted towards developing a wearable air quality sensor to collect data and visualize the data in a story-telling manner. The goal is to educate and empower people in the areas they live.
