	<h2>Music Composition</h2>
		<p>Since I was a kid, I have been playing piano. After receiving numerous accolades through the National Piano Guild, I began writing music indepently at the age of 14. My music has been recognized internationally and I've had the privliege to perform as far as Vienna. A hobby of mine, it is something that has always made me appreciate the way art affects individuals and society.
