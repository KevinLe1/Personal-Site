<h1>About</h1>
	<p>
	I am a second-year student at Columbia University studying operations research and analytics, with a minor in entrepreneurship and innovation. Currently, I work as a technology consultant for music businesses. In school, I am involved with Engineers Without Borders, Design for America, Vietnamese Students Association, CU Records, NYC MakerSpace, and Muse House. I also used to be involved with Columbia Space Initiative and HealthHacks NYC. Prior to Columbia, I worked heavily with robotics and education. I pride myself in being a versatile team player who is able to understand and approach problems from a low level to a high level. This can be seen in my past work, projects, and teams, through which I have experience both in developing and designing impactful solutions from scratch and in managing large-scale projects.

	<h2>Technology Consultant<br><strong>Area of Focus: Music Business<br>Dec. 2017 - Present</strong></h2>
		<p>As a musician, software developer, and designer with experience working within the NYC music industry through all three lenses, I carry a unique and comprehensive understanding of music business that allows me to tackle my clients' pain points from a low level to a high level. My consulting services currently include website strategy and design, development of music data analysis software tailored to a client's needs, development of precise, large-scale music data management software to improve the efficiency of day-to-day operations, and insight on tech-related investments. My primary client is currently Shapiro Bernstein, the oldest independent music publisher in America.

	<h2>Shapiro Bernstein<br><strong>Royalties and Licensing Intern<br>Sept. 2017 - Dec. 2017</strong></h2>
		<p>Shapiro Bernstein is the oldest independent music publisher in the United States. I led the development of software for the analysis of royalty earnings on a global scale, the identification of owned songs missing legal claims across popular streaming platforms (e.x. Spotify), the comparison of income data from third parties (e.x. YouTube, ASCAP), and the filtration of inconsistencies in Shapiro Bernstein's internal database. Additionally, I assisted in general income organizing and office support.

	<h2>Advanced Acoustic Concepts (AAC)<br><strong>Software Engineering Intern<br>June 2017 - Aug. 2017</strong></h2>
		<p>Advanced Acoustic Concepts is a naval defense contractor owned by DRS/Thales. I developed the backend of an automated system testing infrastructure prototype for AAC's tactical simulation software. Previously, any simulation scenario could only be run and recorded manually. The prototype allowed any amount and kind of test to be run based off user-specific criteria. By the end of the summer, the prototype was deemed successful and viable, moving to a partial implementation phase.

	<h2>Columbia Space Initiative<br><strong>NASA Micro-G NeXT Outreach Director &amp Design Team Member</strong></h2>
		<p>As a part of the Micro-G NeXT team, I worked on a small team to develop a subsurface sampling device for asteroid use. Given a set of design criteria, the device was expected to be able to collect both regolith (similar to sand/gravel) and rock core samples while maintaining stratification. After design approval, the device was manufactured and presented at NASA's Neutral Buoyancy Lab in June 2017. There, it was the most successful device at collecting regolith. I also acted as the team's outreach lead, organizing several aerospace workshops and presentations within NYC.

		<p>I designed new engineering curricula and teacher training materials for the Lexington, MA public school system, culminating in a $10,000 initiative to transition the curricula to all elementary schools. After a successful pilot year at 1/3 of the elementary schools in Lexington, $20,000 was added to its funding, and I transitioned the project to a new team. Today, the curriculum has expanded and is fully integrated across all six Lexington elementary public school systems, impacting several thousand students.
