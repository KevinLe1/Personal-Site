<h1>About</h1>
	<p> I am a student at Columbia University studying operations research and analytics, with a minor in entrepreneurship and innovation. What I love about operations research is its focus on optimization, which is my favorite form of problem solving. With a versatile background ranging from programming, to hardware, to higher level design thinking and project management, I pride myself in being a team player who is able to understand and approach problems from a low level to a high level. This can be seen in my past work, projects, and teams, through which I have experience both in developing and designing impactful solutions from scratch and in managing large-scale projects.

	<h2>Shapiro, Bernstein, and Co.<br><strong>Royalties and Licensing Intern<br>Sept. 2017 - Present</strong></h2>
		<p>Shapiro, Bernstein, and Co. is the oldest independent music publisher in the United States. I led the development of software for the analysis of royalty earnings on a global scale, the identification of owned songs missing legal claims across popular streaming platforms (e.x. Spotify), the comparison of income data from third parties (e.x. YouTube, ASCAP), and the filtration of inconsistencies in Shapiro, Bernstein and Co.'s internal database. Currently, I am designing a new website for the company and am developing an internal song catalog system for Shapiro, Bernstein, and Co.

	<h2>Advanced Acoustic Concepts (AAC)<br><strong>Software Engineering Intern<br>June 2017 - Aug. 2017</strong></h2>
		<p>Advanced Acoustic Concepts is a naval defense contractor owned by DRS/Thales. I developed the backend of an automated system testing infrastructure prototype for AAC's tactical simulation software. Previously, any simulation scenario could only be run and recorded manually. The prototype allowed any amount and kind of test to be run based off user-specific criteria. By the end of the summer, the prototype was deemed successful and viable, moving to a partial implementation phase.

	<h2>Forsyth Institute, Immunology Dept.<br><strong>Research Intern<br>July 2015 - Aug. 2015</strong></h2>
		<p>The Forsyth Institute is a leader in oral and systemic disease research. I proposed and conducted an original experiment involving C. elegans and M. smegmatis, a mycobacterium closely related to M. tuberculosis, with a focus on studying how C. elegans impact the unique cell wall and mycolic acid lattice of M. smegmatis. My work eventually held a provisional patent.

	<h2>Columbia Space Initiative<br><strong>NASA Micro-G NeXT Team Member and Outreach Lead</strong></h2>
		<p>As a part of the Micro-G NeXT team, I worked on a small team to develop a subsurface sampling device for asteroid use. Given a set of design criteria, the device was expected to be able to collect both regolith (similar to sand/gravel) and rock core samples while maintaining stratification. After design approval, the device was manufactured and presented at NASA's Neutral Buoyancy Lab in June 2017. There, it was the most successful device at collecting regolith. I also acted as the team's outreach lead, organizing several aerospace workshops and presentations within NYC.
